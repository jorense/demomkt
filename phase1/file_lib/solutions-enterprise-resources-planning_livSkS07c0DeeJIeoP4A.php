									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<div class="in-par pt3">
										<p>Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is an application that integrates a company's various departments and functions into a single collaborative working environment or single system so that information can be shared and can serve the particular needs of different departments. Typical modules in ERP include financial management, procurement and human resources. These modules are flexible enough for customers to install selected modules or the entire ERP package.</p>

<p>PCCW Solutions has over 700 ERP specific professionals, one of the largest ERP teams in the industry, allowing it to service large scale projects such as the nationwide ERP implementation across 31 provinces in the mainland China.</p>

													<h2>Unique Competitive Edge</h2>
													<div class="in-par pt3">
														<p>Very often customers tend to underestimate the complications involved in ERP implementation. The software is less important than the changes in ways companies do business and people do their jobs. This kind of change is not always easy to deal with. To smoothen the transition, you need a service provider with both user and implementer experience. PCCW has been an ERP user for years. We have achieved quantifiable gains in deploying ERP. We can confidently provide consultancy on business-process changes and user training to execute the real transformational ERP effects.
