									<p>The PCCW Solutions Annual Digital Forum 2016 was completed successfully on June 24th. This one-day event has attracted more than 600 delegates from broad spectrum.</p>

									<p>The theme of this year was “Digital Power Shift: Consumers Run Enterprises”. During the Forum, PCCW Solutions has showcased its Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, Infinitum™ Cloud Solutions Suite and latest solutions for specific industries. On the day, we have also announced the launch of D-Infinitum Global Data Center Alliance.</p>

									<p>It was a very unique opportunity that we gathered so many experts to share their industry insights during the keynote speeches, and renowned CIOs and CEOs of big corporations to share how they enhance customer experience and maximize their corporate efficiency through adopting digital solutions. </p>

									<p>Our sincere appreciation to all our customers, sponsors, speakers and delegates to make this event a big success.</p>
