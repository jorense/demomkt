GianChrister Tome  Marketing Practitioner and Technology Junkie PCCW Solutions  The Growing Trend in IoT  Technology has grown far and beyond revolutionary. It has evolved in so many ways and influenced the way we conduct our daily activities and the content we consume on a daily basis. Technology has empowered us to not only connect to anyone, but also to anything, all in real-time. Part of this evolution that enables people to digitally connect and interact with the things around them is what Internet-of-Things (IoT) is all about.  Based on the recent Gartner studies on IoT, it is projected that the spending on this technology will reach a combined total of US$471 billion for professional services, consumer needs, and overall connectivity services by year 2020, which is about 20% CAGR from 20151. With this demand on spending on the technology, enterprises need to provide compatible devices to support the needs of the market; thus, it is projected that there will be US$6.5 billion shipments of IoT endpoints by year 20202. In terms of activation, it is projected that there will be US$63 million new devices activated per second, all within enterprises and consumer products by year 20203.  This trend has evolved due to increased connectivity within consumers who are always on the go and consumes huge volumes of data through their mobile devices. The growth is also affected by societal and infrastructure improvements that enable connectivity for better and faster access as they integrate and utilize IoT solutions. IoT Business Impact  Businesses have determined IoT to be a technological innovation that will greatly shape the way companies operate. May it be internal factors that run the business, or external initiatives geared towards the consumers, businesses will greatly benefit on the evolution of IoT as it continues to grow and shape the technology landscape.  Automation  The implementation of automated processes has been a breakthrough in business technology, and through the emergence of IoT, companies can take advantage of this for better management and analysis of all processes. Data collection will be easier and more accurate which will greatly benefit company decisions and business plans. Automation will also provide companies with full control of their processes, minimizing human errors, and allowing them to access critical information on-the-go through mobile devices.  Efficient Use of Resources  Maximizing the full potential of company resources is what businesses aim to achieve by seamlessly processing and minimizing unnecessary operational expenses. Through an efficient use of IoT technology, businesses can create effective ways for physical resources to work harmoniously with IoT solutions. This minimizes the operational costs and conserves valuable resource utilization, which allows companies to make critical decisions a lot more efficiently.  Enhancing Customer Services  Through the innovations and the extensive mobile influence brought upon by IoT, come a new way for businesses to reach out and communicate to their target customers. Through IoT and the analytics it generates, businesses can create new ways to provide customers with a more interactive user experience based on their behavior, making it more personal and convenient for customers. This also enables companies to provide a better quality of service to enhance brand loyalty and generate new leads for their services as they create a positive emotional response.  Capturing Valuable Data  Mission critical processes are important information companies need to monitor on a daily basis to make sure the business runs smoothly. Through the innovations of IoT, businesses can mend devices and technology together to create intelligent systems that they can use internally. This is crucial to make sure that any real-time changes that affect the business are captured and addressed immediately, enabling the company to predict and make important decisions based on the data and insights gathered.  Innovative Services  As companies adopt IoT technologies and take advantage of their application possibilities through mobile devices and other consumer products, businesses can upgrade their products through innovative value added services. Capturing important analytics and data through IoT, companies can understand their consumers and current products as well as be able to produce new and better product offerings, further enhancing customer experience.  Effective IoT Implementation  Companies that desires to adopt IoT technologies in their own business process need to make sure that they follow best practices to maximize its full potential. Management should keep check of the important principles in implementing IoT.  IoT solutions should be implemented on a unified platform for quality and performance consistency as well as to make it efficient to re-deploy the solution on demand. This will save a lot of time and effort for the management teams on how they utilize the solutions on a daily basis. Businesses should also consider flexibility in the implementation of IoT solutions as such companies should look into an open eco-system setup of managing overall processes. Management should be open in the possibility of tapping into open sources, possible vendors, or to look into in-house development to minimize costs and for a faster deployment of solutions.  Companies should also deploy heterogeneous software applications since IoT technology demands a lot of resources due to data processing and analytical computing. Using more than one kind of processors or cores, these kinds of applications can gain better performance and energy efficiency which businesses can greatly benefit as they utilize IoT technology. These heterogeneous applications can be deployed on a public cloud, a private cloud, or on premise, depending on the access demand of the business. Considering the complexity of IoT technology and the massive data that comes with it, companies should take into account the data protection and end-to-end security of the information they are using. This ensures confidentiality and minimizes any security breach since cyber security is prevalent in the technology sphere today.  Considering that companies are moving to the cloud and adopting IoT technology in general, it is inevitable that businesses should maximize the use of devices and communication networks to tap into the technology. Managing these devices and communication networks should therefore use managed services for flexibility in running these IoT solutions. This makes it easier for businesses to monitor and track the efficiency of the solution and generate sound decisions in real-time as they can access the data anywhere, anytime.

Nilo R. Reyes  Client Partner, Banking, Financial Services and Insurance Industry PCCW Solutions  FinTech is driving innovation in financial services globally and changing the nature of commerce and end-user expectations while shaping the next generation of banking, financial services and insurance. We are pleased to have the industry leaders gathered at PCCW Solutions’ BSFI industry forum to share different forward thinking perspectives.  Our guest speaker from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and executives from PCCW Solutions shared insights on the new technologies and trends that the financial services industry in the region is experiencing, including how enterprises can tackle the challenges and opportunities brought by regulatory compliance requirements.  45% of profit derived from banking and financial services industry is generated in the Asia Pacific region. \"Forget the unicorns, watch out for the Chinese dragons instead, as China is about 18-24 months ahead of the world when it comes to FinTech,\" said Henri Arslanian, who is PwC\'s FinTech & RegTech Lead, China/HK and U.S. Liaison. Ramez Younan, Managing Director of PCCW Solutions, echoed the market potential of banking and financial services industry in Asia Pacific, \"45% of profit derived from banking and financial services industry is generated in the Asia Pacific region. However, we live in the most fragmented region with a lot of regulations and diversified views of governance of the industry.\"  \"Your competitors of the future are not going to be other banks with a digital channel, but are going to be data and tech firms that just happen to be in the insurance and banking space as well,\" said Henri. Banks and financial services firms have to be customer-centric and transform digitally in order to drive growth. Digitalization is the new norm and having a trusted partner in the digital ecosystem helps organizations to be agile, reacting and responding timely to the keen competition.  \"PCCW Solutions is at the forefront to drive FinTech innovation and is committed to be the trusted digital transformation partner in the region,\" Andy Mak, Senior Vice President of PCCW Solutions said. \"We master the blockchain technology to develop different use cases, enabling our clients to deliver innovative services balanced with higher transparency, better customer experience and effective risk management,\" Andy added. According to the onsite polling, over 50% of the delegates responded that they are already using FinTech to provide new services, and also over 50% voted that \"streaming business process\" is the main driver to accelerate blockchain adoption.  Balancing customer experience with risk management  Financial institutions, whether domestic or international, are feeling the competitive pressure to increase revenues, lower operating costs, and delight customers. As such, business models are being redesigned and the use of innovative solutions is getting higher attention to address customer pain points. Although only 37% of all organizations have seriously adopted digitalization in 2016 according to the survey by the World Bank Group, many banks - both retail and non-retail sectors - have commenced their transformation journeys to provide anytime, anywhere banking services, ensuring their processes are aligned to customer expectations and their products and services are insight-based to provide added value.  FinTech players have been introducing technologies such as biometrics to help speed up Know-Your-Customer (KYC) checks to verify customer identity during on-boarding, blockchain to validate required information that are across multiple entities, and AI-powered chatbots that can takeover agents to handle routinary and simple queries instead of human interventions.  While financial institutions need to make sure their customers’ information is protected in the era of high cybercrime, they don’t have to compromise service. With the right strategy and technology partner, a growing number of banks are finding a balance where security and customer experience intersect.  Simplified sign-on makes it easier for customers to use services if multifactor authentication and integrating single sign-on (SSO) are provided. This convenient process lessens customer frustration and speeds up their ability to perform banking tasks. Also, it is vital to keep sensitive company information secured and create an ongoing fraud awareness program for both employees and customers. Engaging a technology provider with proven data-security expertise could prevent data breaches and other forms of cybercrime, thus minimizing not just financial loss but also maintaining customer trust and mitigating reputational risks.  Smart contract for insurance industry  Insurance organizations can consider using blockchain technology to streamline payments of premiums and claims. In addition, blockchain technologies can support significant digital transformation upcoming in the industry since much of the transformation relies on data. For example, actuaries and underwriters are using the ever expanding universe of data to build models to estimate risk and determine pricing more accurately.  During the industry forum, the handling of customer claims was used to highlight typical bottlenecks or issues that customers and insurance organizations face and how blockchain could help. For customers, insurance contracts are typically complex and difficult to understand because of the legal language used. In addition, when accidents happen, customers can often be faced with a complex and drawn-out claims process. From the insurer’s perspective, the industry is facing ever tighter regulation and growing threats from fraud.  Smart contracts driven by blockchain could provide customers and insurers with the means to manage claims in a transparent, responsive, and irrefutable manner. Contracts and claims could be recorded onto blockchain and validated by the network, ensuring only valid claims are paid. For example, the blockchain would reject multiple claims for one accident because the network would know that a claim had already been made. Smart contracts would also enforce the claims triggering payments automatically when certain conditions are validated.  Adopting a common blockchain across the sector could create a step change in value for the insurance industry and claims handling could become more efficient and streamlined, resulting in an improved customer experience. Such an approach could also help to reduce further fraud if identity management was also enforced on the blockchain.  The case implied that a common claims handling platform would still make it possible for individual insurers to compete for customers, offering a range of products and prices by virtue of the smart contracts they set up. Moreover, a blockchain would allow the industry as a whole to streamline its processing and offer a better user experience for customers who have to make a claim. Simultaneously, storing claims and customer information on blockchain would cut down fraudulent activities.', '', '', ''),

The business of using AR/VR has been a growing trend and indeed a promising lucrative business proposition for companies to engage into. These technologies have made companies to reconnect with their customers in a more engaging and interactive way. Different industries are now experimenting and applying the technology and starting to change the way brands are marketed to its customers.  While not as widespread as virtual reality, augmented reality is more dominate and continues to make leaps. Experts predicted that VR and AR will be a US $150 billion market by 2020, with $120 billion of that dedicated to AR. Based on the recent survey, 67% of enterprises are considering adopting AR while VR is said to be 48%. Thanks to AR technology, we are entering an era where marketing can hybridize physical and digital experience.  New Age of Customer Engagement  Executing marketing campaigns using AR/VR technology is all about storytelling, but done in an immersive, and close to experience kind of interaction between customers and the brand. Gone are the traditional collaterals marketers would provide customers to give information about their company offerings. Marketers now let their customers experience their brand first-hand, providing better interactions and revolutionizing the customer journey to drive company revenue.  This is the reason why creative content is crucial for marketers to execute through the use of the technology. Based on a study, 70% of marketing executives are going to spend more on marketing tech this 2017 and will continue to grow . All of these are driven by the innovations of the digital society, dominated by mobile devices majority of people use, especially when they do online purchases. Marketers can maximize their brand’s online presence through the use of AR to create new markets and revenue growth.  Customer Journey Mapping  A customer journey is a set of interactions that a customer has with your business from awareness to purchase. It enables companies to experience first-hand how they can build a better brand, capture their customers effectively and uncover innovation opportunities. At PCCW Solutions, we advocate four stages of customer journey: Aware, Explore, Experience, and Retain. Here are some examples of how to take advantage of AR/VR to create better brand and maximize customer satisfaction along the journey:   Aware – Every customer journey is initiated by ensuring customer is becoming aware of your brand and is starting to consider you as a possible option. As the marketer, your question then becomes, “How do I connect with this potential customer?” Alibaba launched the Buy+ virtual shopping campaign, allowing shoppers in China to browse and buy all over the world. The program reached customers through a variety of digital channels, redefining branding and marketing in today’s internet era. For retailers who do not have a brick-and-mortar presence in their target markets, this could be a game changer.  Explore – Developing creative ways to expose target customers in exploring the brand is the most effective way businesses differentiate themselves from competitors. Providing location-based solutions to deliver compelling marketing content, engaging 3D content, as well as platforms that develops effective e-commerce and real time live support are just a few of the solutions companies can use to communicate with their customers. Major motion pictures like Star Wars, and Jurassic World used virtual content to generate interest, excitement, and strong memory associated with the brand.  Experience – Experiencing the brand at its most personal state is what truly wins customers, and that is what companies aim to do in all their campaigns. Engaging content through Internet of Things, personalized communication through social connections, to the best technology offered by AR/VR are just some of the leading companies can utilize to create better brand story. Adidas used this approach by utilizing AR/VR in their stores, to let customers fit clothes in a simulated fitting room on a virtual environment. The main goal is to let customers experience the benefits of the product first-hand and appreciate the brand the best way possible, and have fun while doing it.  Retain – Attracting new customers while retaining and growing the relationships with existing customers are two of marketers’ top priorities especially for the fast moving industries. Pizza Hut Hong Kong partnered with PCCW Solutions in coming up with an interactive game using augmented reality technology to enhance customer engagement. We designed the AR game with high-quality 3D animated graphics and great user experience created a huge buzz to Pizza Hut’s customers and increased the stickiness to its brand. The AR/VR technology has created an effective product visualization for customers to experience and proves to be a huge deal, especially for brands in the retail industry.  The Next Move  AR/VR technology is going to be an important technology this 2017 and beyond. Companies should start to look at how to realize its potential while the technology continues to evolve. Marketers need to plan and strategize in integrating AR/VR into their marketing campaigns so that it enhances customer experience – make it easier, more fun and more convenient and builds better brand to drive revenue growth. Compelling content through AR/VR is crucial in order to deliver an effective immersive interaction between the customer and the brand. The key to adopting AR/VR is defining the specific activities where it can create real value for the customer.', '', '', ''),

Atul Babu  Head of International Sales PCCW Solutions  Outsourcing as a business practice has existed for a few decades now, with multiple objectives including cost, to let the focus the Enterprises focus on core business and let the non-core be done by another organisation et al, eventually helping the buyer organisation to be more efficient. From the perspective of suppliers, volume & variety of services help them get better with time and eventually passing on more benefits to the buyer. Delivering more and more value with time, at lesser cost and lesser time is non-negotiable. If anyone in the Supply Chain of services, for any Industry does not focus on this, survival will become difficult.  Innovation is not a choice – It is necessity for survival and it cannot be done in isolation. It has to take into consideration different stakeholders in the Eco System and the evolution of different parts around it. The whole concept of Buyer-Supplier needs to be relooked for better benefit and enhanced outcome.  If we look at Outsourcing of IT Services, it has gone through a change with time and it continues to evolve. Lets look at them in the form of 3 Waves. Interestingly, emergence of the next wave has not meant that the earlier Wave became irrelevant. It has continued to Co-exist to give more options for everyone involved.   Wave 1: Sourcing the Skill for a period, for a rate  The tradition Outsourcing focused on providing skilled people to buyer organisation for a particular period and billed as per the time they would spend doing work for the clients. These people should have the required skills and ability to execute the job as per client’s mandate. The clients dictate what they need and take control of the outcome.  Wave 2: Sourcing fixed outcome for a fixed price  This is a more mature model and risk is shared by both parties. In this case, scope is key and it is important to ensure that both sides are sufficiently protected for grey areas to avoid issues later. If defined properly, this gives more control on budget, time and quality – to both sides but the plan has to be detailed and pragmatic with all dependencies and constraints, monitoring closely with proper issue and risk management is extremely critical for the success of this approach.  Wave 3: Outpace Outsourcing  In an age, when the need for Innovation because of Technological advancement, is more than ever and the speed of change is faster than ever, the above two waves are not sufficient. It requires a lot more.  With the Technology evolution, new solutions are getting created, leading to more opportunities at the same time creating room for new unknowns. Most organizations have limited time, money and resources at their disposal to achieve a business solution. A lead organization creating an ecosystem of Partners contributing on complementary strengths could be one of the solutions. The lead organization will start becoming an orchestrator and stitch different solutions together for a substantially higher outcome. The business driver will move away from Cost Saving to expedite innovation. With Digital investments leading to higher returns in a short time, IT’s role itself is going through a change from being a Service provider to Orchestrator of solutions/ services. The IT services organizations will have an opportunity to help the client organizations for not just making IT Smarter by becoming substantially cost effective with much higher outcomes and also helping with innovation. The IT Operations, which continues to take huge share of IT expense, will go through a transformation by high degree of Automation across Applications & Infrastructure. It is interesting that while IT’s job it to automate processes, but IT as a function is still quite manual.  From Commercial perspective, this would mean much higher skill in the game by all partners and everyone’s fate linked to the outcome. This would mean everyone continuously contributes to the success of the whole Eco System and not just protect their own interest. This will change the way every Eco System Partner thinks and behaves.', '', '', ''),

Joseph Au-Yeung  Vice President PCCW Solutions  In the cloud and digital age, business owners have a much wider choice of options on running their IT systems. While a lot of people can understand the value proposition of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), the adoption of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) has been much slower in the market.  Many customers still prefer to own the software on premise instead of using SaaS, because they think it is cheaper to buy the software once and for all. But is that really true?  In most cases, they only compare the initial software licenses fee without paying attention to the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). Besides the one-time software license fee, they seem forgetting about the costs related to server hardware, operating system, database, backup equipment, customization effort, daily support, etc. If all these are put into perspectives, the one-time software license cost just represents 20-30% of the TCO in a 3-5 year span. If you’re interested to know more, you may refer to the TCO calculator provided by Software Advice, a leading software comparison resource.  So, is TCO the only consideration for SaaS adoption? Definitely not. There are at least three more areas you should consider in the on-premise vs SaaS scenario.  The first one is“opportunity cost”. When a business pays a large upfront cost for a software solution, it no longer has that cash available to grow the business. That money could be spent on marketing to attract more customers or on sales people to help grow more revenue.  The second thing is about core competency. If you acquire some software and implement it on-premise, this is often an automation reflecting the best way you know how to run the business. On the other hand, a SaaS solution usually comes with templates customized for a particular industry which is indeed a refinement of the business process by implementing the software for tens, or even hundreds of time in the past. By deploying SaaS solutions, it gives the business a chance to learn and elevate their process to the “industry best practice” standard.  The last but not least thing is about “data”. Customer data has become the single most important asset in the 21st century for a company to survive. If there is any natural disaster where your on-premise equipment is located, will you suffer from any loss of data? Even if you are putting the equipment in a “carrier-grade” data center, who is going to ensure your data will be back up regularly? Are you willing to spend the extra money to store the data in multiple locations to cater for a disaster? If you are concerned of these possibilities, then SaaS is an option for you.

If “Back To The Future” were a Hong Kong movie, there would likely be scenes where Marty from 1985 arrives in 2015 at the airport in Chek Lap Kok (no longer Kai Tak!) and finds it incredibly technological. However, such technological advances would not seem so unthinkable to us today. Indeed, with these digital solutions our travel experience can be largely enhanced.  Runway to an Intelligent Airport  The Hong Kong International Airport handled 63.3 million passengers last year, representing an annual growth of 5.7% from 2013. Similarly, the increase in aircraft movement was about 5.1%, meaning the handling capacity of the airport is increasingly under pressure. To ease the ever-growing “workload”, apart from the newly completed West Apron Expansion which offers more parking stands for planes and other related supporting facilities, and the Midfield Development which includes a new 5-level concourse due to be completed by the end of this year, innovative digital solutions provided by PCCW Solutions can be the answers.  With digital technologies like real-time crowd monitoring, digitalised traveller information collection, travel pattern analysis, etc., the airport’s overall operation including queue time management, allocation of workforce, security, even “no show” passengers locating can be improved. Similarly, retail businesses will also benefit as with the introduction of technologies like interactive digital shopping wall, iBeacon voucher, and the availability of Big Data for consumer behaviour analysis and marketing campaign planning, shopping will be made more convenient and pleasurable, hence higher sales revenue.   Taking off with your Digital Companion  But what about our experience as travellers? Air travel is playing an increasingly important role in Hong Kong people’s life. Be it for holiday, business, or study, taking a flight abroad is nowadays getting common. With more and more budget airlines being available in the region, leaving town for vacation becomes much more affordable and popular. But with so many people travelling each day, while the schedules of Hong Kong people are generally quite hectic, how can our travel experience be enhanced? How can the quality of travel be improved, when the quantity of travellers is on the rise every year?  Imagine a mobile application that can consolidate all your travel arrangements, from planning to commuting to taking off, on one single platform, virtually a Digital Companion. The application would have stored all your flight bookings, so that 48 hours before a flight, a notification will be sent to your phone to remind you of the flight, weather information of the destination, packing tips, currency exchange rate, even options to purchase travel insurance. It would also help you book a seat at an airport lounge, or a taxi to the airport, should so be required.   On the day of departure, it reminds you when it is time to head to the airport, the available modes of commute with fares and time needed. When you approach the airport, it tells you which terminal, aisle and counter to go for check-in, which would have been expedited thanks to the help of self-help luggage drop-off. Paper boarding pass will not be necessary because a digital one would have been sent to your phone. You will also receive a real-time update of your journey planner, telling you how much time it will take you to go through security and immigration, hence how much time left for leisure like shopping, relaxing in an airport lounge, etc. Of course, with the real-time function, the Digital Companion will always advise you on which the fastest route is, no matter for security check, immigration process, or accessing the lounge. If you feel like doing a bit of shopping before departure, why not? Because shopping has been made less laborious since you no longer need to carry your own purchase, they will be sent to your boarding gate for pick-up before departure. Touch wood, but in case of any flight delay, the Digital Companion will for sure notify you. So there you go, that’s how you kick off a hassle-free travel!  Similarly, when you return to Hong Kong after a trip, once you have landed, the real-time Digital Companion will again update you on the time needed for going through immigration and luggage collection, the best routes to take, etc. So returning from a trip doesn’t feel that bad after all!  Now, fasten your seat belt, and be ready to travel to the future!  More Details of Digital Airport Solutions', '', '', ''),

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) endorsed this consensus and issued a circular in June 2004 requesting banks to implement such security measure by June 2005 for high-risk retail Internet banking transactions.  In line with the HKMA\'s guideline, CITIC Ka Wah Bank (the \"Bank\") has adopted PCCW Solutions\' OneKey - a highly sophisticated and secure authentication service to protect banking customers engaging in online banking transactions.  The technology used in its OneKey Solution will be totally transparent to our customers, yet it can provide our customers with total confidence by frustrating any criminal attempts operating through the Internet. We are confident that this will encourage our customers to transact more via our i-banking services in future.”  Lorainne Lam Executive Vice President and Head of Retail Banking Group CITIC Ka Wah Bank Challenges CITIC Ka Wah Bank required a cost-effective solution to tackle the latest Internet banking frauds such as fraudulent bank websites and phishing emails. It has planned for a dual option two-factor authentication, allowing i-banking customers to use either Hongkong Post\'s e-Cert or SMS-based one-time password for conducting their high-risk online transactions. The Bank was facing a tight implementation deadline to launch the two-factor authentication by June 2005. It required a proven security solution that can be easily and quickly integrated with the Bank\'s existing i-banking system with minimal customization efforts. In addition, the security platform must be user-friendly and reliable.    Solutions PCCW Solutions has helped CITIC Ka Wah Bank to successfully rollout the two-factor authentication service under the tight schedule. With the introduction of OneKey, a PCCW Solutions\' self developed authentication solution that employs state-of-the-art security technologies, the Bank\'s Internet banking customers receive double protection by being assured that not only is their e-Cert verified but that the website they have logged onto is legitimate. OneKey greatly enhances security without compromising performance and ease of use. OneKey serves as a technology overlay to the Bank\'s existing i-banking platform. It does not, however, access the CITIC Ka Wah Bank\'s proprietary customer database so customer data privacy is protected.  PCCW Solutions had assisted Hongkong Post with the incorporation of e-Cert into Smart ID card and is familiar with the e-Cert and information security solutions. Our proven expertise makes PCCW Solutions a trusted partner in securing online transactions.  On top of OneKey solution, PCCW Solutions has also provided the necessary hardware and software for CITIC Ka Wah Bank to build the SMS one-time password system with the Bank\'s SMS Gateway.  Value Created In June 2005, CITIC Ka Wah Bank launched its dual option i-banking two-factor authentication on PCCW Solutions\' OneKey platform, allowing banking customers the flexibility and convenience of using either the Hong Kong Post e-Cert or SMS transaction passwords for conducting their online banking transactions in a secure Internet environment. The solution effectively minimizes online banking frauds.  The increased peace-of-mind for Internet banking users can be expected to encourage wider adoption of online services of a financial nature, as well as bring benefits in many other areas of life.', '中信嘉华银行: OneKey 双要素身份验证解决方案 银行、金融和保险业, 成功案例,  客戶案例', '', ''),
