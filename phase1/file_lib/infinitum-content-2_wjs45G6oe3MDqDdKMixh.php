									<p>In view of the growing acceptance of Internet banking services and sophistication of Internet banking frauds, the banking industry reached a general consensus in 2004 to strengthen the Internet banking security by implementing two-factor authentication. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) endorsed this consensus and issued a circular in June 2004 requesting banks to implement such security measure by June 2005 for high-risk retail Internet banking transactions.</p>
									<p>In line with the HKMA's guideline, CITIC Ka Wah Bank (the "Bank") has adopted PCCW Solutions' OneKey - a highly sophisticated and secure authentication service to protect banking customers engaging in online banking transactions.</p>

								<p>CITIC Ka Wah Bank required a cost-effective solution to tackle the latest Internet banking frauds such as fraudulent bank websites and phishing emails. It has planned for a dual option two-factor authentication, allowing i-banking customers to use either Hongkong Post's e-Cert or SMS-based one-time password for conducting their high-risk online transactions. The Bank was facing a tight implementation deadline to launch the two-factor authentication by June 2005. It required a proven security solution that can be easily and quickly integrated with the Bank's existing i-banking system with minimal customization efforts. In addition, the security platform must be user-friendly and reliable.</p>

										<h2 class="mb0 pb3 mt5">Solutions</h2>
										<p>PCCW Solutions has helped CITIC Ka Wah Bank to successfully rollout the two-factor authentication service under the tight schedule. With the introduction of OneKey, a PCCW Solutions' self developed authentication solution that employs state-of-the-art security technologies, the Bank's Internet banking customers receive double protection by being assured that not only is their e-Cert verified but that the website they have logged onto is legitimate. OneKey greatly enhances security without compromising performance and ease of use. OneKey serves as a technology overlay to the Bank's existing i-banking platform. It does not, however, access the CITIC Ka Wah Bank's proprietary customer database so customer data privacy is protected.</p>
										<p>PCCW Solutions had assisted Hongkong Post with the incorporation of e-Cert into Smart ID card and is familiar with the e-Cert and information security solutions. Our proven expertise makes PCCW Solutions a trusted partner in securing online transactions.</p>
										<p>On top of OneKey solution, PCCW Solutions has also provided the necessary hardware and software for CITIC Ka Wah Bank to build the SMS one-time password system with the Bank's SMS Gateway.</p>
