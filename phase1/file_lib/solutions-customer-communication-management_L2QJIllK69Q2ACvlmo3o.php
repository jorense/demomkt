									<h2>Communications</h2>

									<p>Whether direct mailing or email marketing, we know how to communicate with your customers. Our service covers management of marketing campaigns, concept creation and layout design, as well as copywriting, translation, graphic design, artwork production, illustration and animation.</p>


									<h3><strong>Direct marketing</strong></h3>


									<p>Mail-merging technology is used to manage the design, printing, letter-shopping and delivery of hardcopy promotional materials such as leaflets, posters and brochures, as well as address labels, postcards, envelopes, barcodes and personal letters. We also provide value-added services such as document folding, insertion and enveloping. Rest assured, your direct marketing campaign will run like clockwork.</p>

									<h3><strong>Email marketing</strong></h3>

									<p>You can rely on PCCW Solutions to manage multiple campaigns concurrently, involving the design and creation of electronic direct mail (edm), delivering up to 30,000 edm units per hour in a secure manner and providing reports containing statistics on aspects such as the number of edm units opened, click rate, bounce back, and opt-out.</p>


									<p>Email marketing is an effective way of promoting products, services and events among business prospects, existing clients, members and target groups – and a great way to build brand awareness and customer relations.</p>


									<p>Email marketing allows links to be embedded in messages, which drives website traffic and empowers recipients to act on messages immediately in terms of downloading, registering and completing sales inquiry forms.</p>

									<h3><strong>Why email marketing?</strong></h3>

									<ul class="bullet-list">
										<li>Fast – delivers bulk email fast with just one click.</li>
										<li>Low cost – much more cost-effective than traditional marketing.</li>
										<li>Targeted – marketers can tailor promotions effectively by demographics and with a well-structured database.</li>
										<li>Highly customized – marketers can tailor email to each recipient, according to customer database information.</li>
										<li>Build brand awareness, loyalty and relationships with clients.</li>
										<li>Generate sales, downloads, inquiries and registrations.</li>
										<li>Environment friendly – all you need is an email list, an email marketing software/platform and your content. Email marketing is much more environment friendly than printed catalogs or direct mailing.</li>
