												<p>PCCW Solutions helps customers build extraordinary data centers according to our design-and-build principles of scalability, versatility, security and connectivity. Scalability requires the site to be flexible enough to meet client needs in space provision and equipment allocation. Versatility stands for implementation of high redundancy and diversity in electrical and other installations, such as MVAC systems and telecommunications network, to ensure operations are never compromised. Security covers how we can best protect a customer’s data and systems. Finally, Connectivity ensures use of multiple carriers with a dual lead-in policy to guarantee non-stop operation of services.</p>
