									<h2>Unique competitive edge</h2>
									<div class="in-par pt3">
										<h3><strong>Flexibility format and high quality</strong></h3>
										<p>Streaming Service is based on popular standard video content delivery technologies that include Windows Media, Adobe Flash and MPEG4. These proven technologies provide a robust and flexible platform for delivering standard definition (SD) and high definition (HD) media to users all over the world. Using standard technology, any device running a different OS (eg Windows, Mac OS X, iOS or Android) is able to playback a video without complex setup or configuration. Support of standard streaming protocols means customers can easily connect their encoders to our streaming servers and provide live streaming.</p>

										<h3><strong>Highly reliable</strong></h3>
										<p>Streaming Service offers high levels of resilience. As well as achieving local resilience by using a set of streaming servers to provide the same video content, sets of servers are located at two different locations to provide an even more reliable service. If one set of servers falls out of service because of a site problem, another set at a different location swings into action to provide service.</p>

										<h3><strong>Scenario</strong></h3>
										<p>A multimedia and web design company wanted to expand its website and integrate video into a project showcase. In order to lower investment cost, an on-demand video streaming service was established by embedding flash video in the website to demonstrate the high quality of the agency’s work. The company uploads video content to streaming servers, and a link to content was added to the website’s player. Audiences all over the world can now view the content without having to load onto the web server. </p>
